# Google+ user feed

Get Google+ user posts as an RSS feed (to export it to Twitter, Facebook, ...)

Use it and get more information at **http://plusfeed.frosas.net/**

## TODO

- Notify me internal errors
- Functional testing
  - Home and feed
  - Use http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/
- Take javascript out of HTML (use require.js?)
- Display errors inline (not as an alert)
- Include full content into the RSS item body (to consume it as any other RSS feed)
- Open links in the same window or a new one?
- Mark visited links
- Also accept user profile URL
- Change example feed (Alireza posts every photo in its own post)
- http://plusfeed.frosas.net/110101110100111001011 (error 500)
